    "explanation": "The student's response describes types of faults (normal and reverse faults) and their characteristics, which is not related to the provided correct answer about folds (antiforms and synforms). Therefore, the student's response does not match the provided correct answer."

    "score": true,
    "explanation": "The student's response correctly identifies the principle that states deeper rocks are older as the Law of Superposition. Although the student used 'Law of Superposition' instead of 'principle of superposition', the meaning is the same and aligns with the provided correct answer."

    "score": false,
    "explanation": "The student's answer, while detailed and informative, does not directly match the provided correct answer 'rocks behave plastically'. The student's response discusses both brittle and ductile behavior, faulting, and folding, which goes beyond the scope of the provided correct answer."

    "score": false,
    "explanation": "The student's response provides a detailed explanation of various geological processes that can occur when rock units are subjected to vertical pressure. However, the possible correct answer is specifically 'they shorten and become thicker,' which the student's response does not explicitly state. Therefore, the student's answer does not match the provided correct answer."
